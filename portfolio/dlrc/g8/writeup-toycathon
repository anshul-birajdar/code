The toy is a model of the various types of triangles. It has six triangles in two categories. First three are acute obtuse and right triangles, based on the their angles. The other three are equilateral, isosceles, and scalene, based on their side lengths. The triangles pop out and are a good way to visualize the ideas. Students are literally able to feel the triangles. The terms are just formal names given to them and the students can recognize the distinguising factor in the triangle and fill it accordingly in the blanks of the incomplete sentences (like fill in the blanks), themselves. Unused cardboard is found in everyone's home. The model can be even cut out from a cheap cardboard pencil containers, which students buy and stick ordinary paper on it. An additional challenge can be that the triangles could be cut and we could ask the students to stick them together after fitting all of them in.
