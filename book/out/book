Preface
I have written this book to help you understand the importance of not having a fiat-based system


What is economics?
Economics is a field of study that studies how people value things and the production and consumption of goods
and services. If you have a Rs. 500 Note, What can you do with it?
If you have 1 silver coin, what can you do with that?
If you have a toy, what can you do with that?
There are limited resources and unlimited wants.
In economics  there are two sides. One is the goods and services side and  the other is the money side. 
Before money, there was barter.

Barter means exchanging goods for other goods instead of selling them for money. For example, if you have a Harry Potter
book and you trade it for a Game of thrones book.
But in real life, even to buy the book, you need money.

Money means a generally accepted medium of exchange which is:
fungible:all Rs.1=Rs.1
Durable:able to circulate without much damage Divisible:Rs.1=100p
Portable:can be carried around easily.
Scarcity:supply that can be made should be limited.
Store of value:It should hold its value for long periods of time.

Seeing this you might wonder, How come rupee is a store of value, it constantly devalues itself by 3%
per year?,which is huge.
Well, the Indian Rupee is not money, it is a currency, a money subsititute,it works because of its 
legal tender status, that is forcing people to accept it.

Rupee is really a silver coin, but it has been devalued.

Basics of economics
The most basic thing in economics is demand and supply.
If there is a lot of onion, onions will be cheap, the reverse will happen if onions are not available. 
Let’s say you want a toy car, and everyone wants a toy car, there are only so many cars available at same time and
everyone is buying a lot of them, this temporarily pushes the price up, and then to regular levels.
Now we will discuss about resources. Let’s say you own a large toy factory which makes toy train sets.
To make the toy, you need plastic. As plastic is not unlimited, there is a cost you have to pay,
so that  the plastic makers can part their plastic.This is decided on the demand-supply of plastic as mentioned before.
They sell their plastic for the paper rupee as most people will give them rupees and they expect that they can
(or their shareholders can) acquire goods and services for that money.
A company is a organisation of people (or part-owners / share-holders).A company, lets take the toy company,
you will need to design the train and the tracks. If you don’t know how to make tracks,then you will employ people,
if you want to invest you money, you can otherwise raise money by selling your part-ownership in the company.
Then you have enough money to build the factories and the brand.When someone buys your toy , you make a slight   profit,
that is Selling Price-Cost Price or CP-SP.
The profits can then be used to make a better product, or be given to the shareholders as dividends.
How can the the resources be distributed?
 By land ownership, which can be used  to mine silver, gold, aluminium, steel, etc, can be used to grow crop,etc.
There are two  parts of economics, microeconomics and macroeconomics.

The Central problem of an economy is that 
a)What resources you have
A farmer, who lives there before owning, owns the land.
He can sell it, others can buy it, mine for metals, or farm for crop
Hence, the divisibility problem is solved.
The things you make are yours or you earn you salary.
Anything your owned companies own, you partly own,etc.

b)What should be produced
This depends on the owners and what is the demand.

c)Who wants these goods
Whoever wants it.

Microeconomics

Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies of the behaviour of the people and companies
For example if people dump a lot of shares on the stock market(where people buy and sell stuff, in this case shares)
then, accoriding to demand and supply, the price will fall.
Factors of microeconomics include demand-supply,economies of scale
(which means producing a lot of stuff at once,more effectively),and what people and companies want and have.

Lets say your train set is is getting popular,and there is a lot of demand, then you can raise the price of your train,
but if you have less demand, you can lower the price, and start advertising your product.

If there is  a lot of demand for steel , when the economy is booming steel prices have to rise.

If the economy is at a standstill, then oil prices will fall, as in 2020.If the taxes on oil increase, then prices will rise.

If fiat money supply incereases, prices will rise.
This is known as inflation.

If a major company goes bust, the stock market will crash.
If a major company reported a 20% increase in revenue the stock market will generally rise.

Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the economy as a whole.It uses central control such as tax rate, interest rate, to regulate the growth of the economy.
It uses metrics such as:
GDP:Sum of all transactions
Employment rate: No. Of adults having a job
Inflation: rise in the money supply,which raises prices
energy prices:cost of electricity
and other metrics to manupilate the growth.
The central bank, which holds the power to control interest rate and the money supply can do a lot of damage using 
macroeconomics like in 1920’s when it suddenly raised rates which caused many banks to go bust because they had
lent money at a lower rate, and now the fed has raised rates dramatically, which caused a lot of losses and then 
collapse of the banks.The economy which relies on the banks also collapsed.This caused a problem.After that, 
the Fed wanted to create a boom in the economy, so it lowered rates fast, and increased money supply. This lead 
to a great boom and bust in the stock market, as well as a complete collapse of a lot of banks.This caused the great 
depression.Although currently people are able to borrow money and start new businessess, they don’t know the long
term impact.If there were no central bank rates would be normalised because if the savers want higher rates for their 
savings and the lenders want a lower rate for their borrowing, they will choose the middle option as there will be
no money where there is low rates, this will force them to lower rates for borrowing and saving to the middle,if 
the savings rate is high,so borrowing rate also has to be higher. There will be a lot money deposited, but no one will 
borrow for such a high rate,this will force them to lower rates.
But the central banks have all time low borrowing rates, this is bad because the savers will also get less
(inflation adjusted) 7 (Max. Savings rate in fd) -5 (real inflation)=2% (real saving rate)

This is the more evil part of economics, as it tends to have central control, like communism

Various schools of thought in economics- Austrian, Keynsian,Communist

Austrian ecnomics roughly says that the economy is a complex machine and shouln’t be controlled by a single entity.
This means silver/gold coins are preferred. No central bank.The role of the government is to defend us,to build 
infrastucture, mint silver/gold coins in verified amounts to allow trade, and regulate companies for their foul play
and uncompetitive behaviour. It also says that let businessess go bust,
don’t create central banks, and the economy is a evoloving system and not a machine.

Keynsian economics argues that free market requires regular intervention. This idea was cerated during the great
depression as people started to think that the gold standard, less regulation,resulted in the great depression,
it was quite the opposite. I have talked about this in the macro economic section.The bretton woods system,
which gave USA a lot of power as £¥₹ were backed by dollars. The dollars, then were convertible to gold. The US printed
a lot more dollar than it had gold to back it up.After that even if countries tried, they couldn’t go back to the gold
standard because most the gold is in the US and the price is a lot lower. The gold was in the US, but they could import
a lot of stuff buy just printing dollars (look at the US debt it is larger than the entire GDP of China, and USA itself,
as of 2021).
That means they can send dollars, and the world will send them stuff.

Communism believes that government should own everything and  everyone should work for  the government.

Various schools of thought are liked by many, but laissez fairre capitalism is the principle that works the best.
The Austrians completely support this,the keynsians are OK with it and communist completely oppose it.

Austrian Economics

Silver and gold can hold a lot of value in a single place.
Your life savings in a bag.Fiat money is devalued at a rated of 2-5% per year. If you compound it,it’s huge!
Fiat money can be created out of thin air.What is the fiat thing I am talking about? Well your ₹$£¥ are all fiat,
at least the day-to-day ones. The rupee has lost ~99.9% of its value! The dollar >95%.If this continues,
we will have th carry 50 rupee coins that have the value of todays 1 rupee. Even the inflation rate is understated.
Central banks have central control,they are the sole issuer of currency,they have the control over the interest rate,
which has devastating consequences (for example 1920s 1970s 200s and the upcoming 2021 crisis).Central banks have
always printed more promissory notes than there is money.

If there is no central banks, there will be less booms and busts,and if you let these businessess go bust, this will 
allocate the capital properly.

Gold and silver price have been severly understated because the big bank have large short positions in silver.
The USA has a lot of welfare programs like social security , medicare,child tax credit,free education,etc, which costs the 
US government a lot of money. Even the taxes are low, and they aren’t rising anytime soon.

The economy is an evolving system and not a machine,so the government can’t possibly know all the information necessary 
to change things, but companies will. Also there is no competition to the government, but there is to the companies, 
this lowers the prices to correct levels.

Keynsian Economics

The Great depression,which was caused by the fed had caused great troubles.
People started blaming the gold/silver standard for this.  The real reason for this was the federal reserve.

What happened was that the fed raised rates rapidly, those banks who had lent their money believed that they would
borrow the money back from the fed at a lower rate, to their surpise, the rates were very high. 

The thing that caused higher rates was something that was know as the deflation commission.
They thought that raising rates would deflate the money supply without causing any problems.

After the banks collapsing,the Fed started to think about creating a “boom” which resulted in lower rates,
which resulted in a boom and bust (a bigger bust) of the economy.

If the free market had controlled the rates,the rates would balanced out as noone will borrow if the rate is more 
and no one will deposit (atleast the big ones) if rates are low.

The government was to provide specific amounts of precious metals to trade, instead ,
they are cheating us and not providing precious metals.

The US, even has the same design on the coins as the silver ones, while having a fraction of the price if 
you melt those coins.

The big banks even control the price of silver, by creating ETFs, which stands for Exchange Traded Fund,
but is a total scam as they print hundreds of times more silver or gold certificates
than they have silver in their vaults.

This creates a lot more supply than there actually is.

Adam Smith, who is the founder of capitalism , said that cost of anything , is the labour required to produce it. 
(finding,mining,etc for metals).

The labour required to print pieces of paper, or type on a computer is negligible, so the price of ETF+real supply is low.
Fiat money is basically any money that can be created out of thin air and doesn’t have intrinsic value.
This may change in the near future if people come to a realisation that ETF is not a real silver, but is just
a non-redeemable promissory note.

Welfare policies and their effect on the economy.

    • Social security
      
    • medicare
      
    • medicaid
      
    • child tax credit
      
    • free education
      
    • free day care
      
    • etc

cost money

Where do the get this money from ? The taxes don’t even make a dent in the debt pile

The debt pile is in the trillions 28 Trillion, maybe 30 40 50 60 100. Then comes all the stimulus,
tax credits, infrastructure, etc, etc.  Even if they spend their entire tax revenue on it will take years to improve.

US government needs to pay salaries to his employees,  pay all sorts of bills , and much more, 
so it will take even more time to repay the debt.

If the inflation turns into hyperiflation, this will crash the economy.
The Federal reserve bank (central bank of USA) says that everything is OK (it isn’t). If they say that the economy is in  
a big trouble, this will crash the markets. 

Race to the bottom!

Most central bankers and central planners often say one phrase many times, which is, you guessed it, “Race to the bottom”.

They often say this for taxes,GDP,etc,etc, but I am talking about the fiat system itself that these central bankers have 
created.

They are constantly devaluing their currecy , at the same time, so that people don’t understand that the currencies 
have fallen.

But the scary thing is that the entire fiat system collapsing. This is coming soon.

Put the genie back in the bottle!

The “Fed” which is neither federal nor has reserves say that they can put the inflation genie back in the bottle or 
cut inflation by raising rates, but they can’t do that.
Why?
Because they have 28+ Trillion dollars in debt, it will absolutely crush the insolvent government.

Even if the government didn’t get crushed, the economy will be in one of the worst depressions in the history of central 
banking, and all the blame would be transferred to the Federal Reserve ie “Fed”.

Bonds, Bonds and Bonds

The US government unloads a lot of treasuries ( i.e US govt. debt, i.e. bonds). The supply of those bonds increases, so 
the nominal price for those bonds should decrease, i.e rising interest rate, as the payment is fixed, but just the
opposite happens.

Why?
Because the “fed” buys a lot of bonds by creating money out of thing air and giving it to the primary dealer banks
i.e. the top bankers club some money. This leaves really less bonds actually circulating, hence the low yeilds.

The US government and federal reserve play this sort of role, otherwise the economy would have collapsed.

The fed created the great depression, 1970s stagflation,2000s tech bubble, and 2007-8 real estate crash.

Now all of those combined is coming i.e great depression+stagflation+tech bubble+real estate bubble. 

This is going to be a really bad time!
The federal government and the “fed” are going to keep on doing this, but to save from this are only to options.

Keynsian Economics End

Keynsian economics was started by John Maynard Keynes in the great depression because he thought that the economy was not
controlled enough.

But this was false as, before the fed, when there were no wars and no central banking in the  USA,
there was no crash as big as or even distantly close to the great depression or the dot com crash or 2008.

The end of keynsian economics may not necessarily  be near, but their ideas are going to fail and be disproven really quickly.

The one thing that he said right was "Ideas shape the course of history." 

The recession have become worse, every time (dot com vs 08)

Centralized power often leads to disasted:Fall of communism ,and keynsian economics

As the Classical and Austrian economics don’t say that do this , do that ,etc, they are just mere observations of the 
free market and not a controlling market like a Keynesian economy, as the government wouldn’t provide the interest 
rates and constantly changing the value of their money, the progress is dependant on the magical hand that is the 
free market, that the government has wounded.

Communism fell as the govt. officials didn’t care producing  better products that the economy needs.

Like that, the government has no incentive to lower rates, even the central bankers do not have any incentive 
to better their economy and drive progress.

This means that eventually the free market has to win.

The fed is not a part of the government but a public private partnership.

Let’s see what happens to the “Fed”

Borrowing vs printing

From the outside, it may seem that the US government is “borrowing” the money from the free market,
but the opposite is true, they are “injecting” the money into the free market by printing it. 

How is this possible?
It is possible because of what I call the “Printing to Borrowing” activity.

Basically what is done is that the govt borrows the money from the primary dealer banks, they then sell the bond to the fed.
The “fed” doesn’t doesn’t recieve a lot of money or any money, so it has to print the money out of thin air, otherwise it 
will cause deflation or 0% inflation and 0% deflation.

Short-term inflation and rebound vs long-term inflation and their effects.

Short term inflation means short term rise in (money supply * velocity)+ or - short term problems which causes prices to
rise and fall to the same levels

Long-term inflation means long term rise in prices caused by a huge increase in the money supply

Did you understand the difference (cause and effect)?

For example, the cost required to make a book goes up because of a fire in the forests, it will rebound after some time.

The increase in the money supply will cause all things’s prices to go up every year. For example if a book costs 50 rupees 
and inflation is 5%, in five years, the cost will be 65 rupees.A 30 % increase.

This means that Keynsian economy’s currency’s value declines over time, then how do the coins have their value?

Let it Go!

Capitalism was founded on the basis, that the “capital” or money will be allocated properly by individuals properly.
Let’s say there is a big bank, who lends money to this questionable, but big company. Now this company goes bust, the 
company had loaned the money from the banks, now the money is lost. This means that the banks who had lent the money 
to this company, their money is lost. They had not lent the money properly, then it’s their fault, such an institution
should not exist.

If these irresponsible banks lend their money to these people, then these banks’s account holders money,
or the general public’s money is lost. This means that the failed institution loses the money.

If you let these big megacorporations go bust, the capital will outflow from their companies and to the share
holder,who then can do good to the economy ie spend or create new companies (invest)

Banking Speculators

The banks have be turned into speculators because, they are cheated by the fiat, as they are lending in a more 
valuable rupee and getting returned in a lesser valued rupee, that means, that their returns are diminished 
and they are fooled.

The banks, using people’s money, have started to put the money directly into the stock market. This yeilds a higher 
return, and is also a roughly accurate measure of inflation (at good times, and indexes like 
Nifty50 or Standard and Poor’s S&P 500).

This means that, if the banks remove their money , or a big crisis (like I am predicting) occurs, then the banks will 
face severy problems, that means, the people may or may not be able to get their money or the money’s value 
will be the value of the piece of paper (like 1920s germany Weimar Republic).

Export oriented growth and globalization

Export oriented growth is on rise as people think that exporting will be good for the economy, but let’s think the 
following. Peter Schiff has made this analogy:

There are 5 asians (indians,chinese), and one american. They are hungry, so they divide the work as follws:
One asian will do the hunting, another will fish, third will search for vegetation, fourth will cook the 
food and the fifth will cook food.The american will eat the food.

This means that there is no need of exporting to be good, but to raise GDP and show that things are made in India, 
this is a good thing.

Save! Save! Save!

They always encourage people to save money, but with the rapidly declining value of paper currencies like the rupee or
the dollar. The inflation metric used by the cental banks, always understates inflation. Even if you count the inflation
rate in India, as 6 percent and save for 20 years, your savings will be cut in third, in reality, it is a lot worse because
of the rupee losing a lot more value.

Dollar to Rupee is a not-so-good way to measure the debasement of the rupee to the dollar, because they can , and do
devalue their currencies at once, to fool people into thinking that the money didn’t lose power.

The move from US to China, and China without global demand is impossible.

The Chinese economy is built around export, as all the technology, all the standards, all the Intellectual propterty
belongs to US,etc owners, the Chinese don’t have any right to produce the chips, the mobiles, the equipment, etc, etc 
if the Intellectual property owners (eg. Intel:USA,ARM:England,etc) block them from making theese.

The cheap plastic products that they make, also can be made  elsewhere, for example India, US, Europe, UK, etc, etc.

When people buy stuff, if they import it, they then send the gold or silver abroad , which decreases the money supply, 
causing deflation, so their stuff becomes more competitive than the imported stuff, beacause their is a cost to ship 
these products.

If the nations are industrialised, and they have the knowledge and skills necessary to make stuff 
(all of them have including India-recently), they can, or have to, make the stuff in their own country.

In the current system, the US prints the money, then it sends it to China, which invests them in US 
treasuries (promissory notes to fiat dollars) 

or

sends the money for the belt and road initiative, as converting the dollar to ¥ Chinese Yen would cause the 
yuan’s value to rise and make China uncompetitive.

The reason of this is the floating exchange system and competitiveness.

The floating exchange system is a system that measures the value of the currency on deman and supply. 

If a car manufacturer  in the USA wants to buy $100,000 worth of cars from India. 

If the exchange rate is 70 to 1, they will get Rs. 7 Crore, if rate is 50 they will get Rs. 5 crore, whereas, 
to produce the car, it requires the same amount of money (mostly).

The wealth of a society is not the amount of currency units in circulation, but the things that you can buy.

Because if you have a lot of silver and no goods, what can you buy? Nothing.

USA has a lot of wealth.

China has a lot of influence over the world.

But this is unfair because China gives stuff to USA, but USA just gives them digital pieces of paper.

China is creating a huge set of problems in the South China Sea,using it’s newfound influence over the world and in the 
Kashmir region that belongs to india, also in Tibet, which shouldn’t belong to China, but should be independant,
and in Xingjang province in China where the Uyghurs live.

The new novel – corona virus also comes from China.
We don’t know that they have made the virus in a lab or not, but they stopped the virus from being reported
in the international media.

If they had reported a new virus has been found and the world (atleast India and the US) would be immediately in
lockdown mode, stopping the virus from spreading.

Reserve requirements and ban  on speculation

Banks were heavily regulated, as not to allow people to borrow to speculate (or put in the stock market).
This was so that the stock market was based on the economy and not the other way around.

What is the stock market?
The stock market is the market that determines the price of the big companies, which shape the economy.

If you encourage speculation,then it will just create a bigger boom and bust cycle.
The market is always in a boom and bust cycle.

For example if we see that internet giants are earning a lot of money, then the internet stocks will rise.

If a big internet provider reports a loss, the tech stocks will fall.

These boom and bust cycle don’t cause any  problems, if and only if the government dosen’t allow people 
to borrow money, just to put into the stock market, as the money entered into the stock market.
Most of the money has to exit some way or the other.

Great depression and the run on the banks

The term “run on the bank” means that everyone is rushing to the bank to withdraw their money at once.
Of course, the banks don’t have all the money with them at once, this doesn’t mean,
that they don’t have the money, it’s just that it is not available at once.
The great depression caused most banks to fail , this resulted in a bigger depression,
this was caused by the  central bank of the United states, the federal reserve.

All of these banks, who already lent the money, of course don’t have the money in hand.
This is how things work, but the depression, which was caused by the “fed”, this resulted in the great 
depression, and the run on the banks. 

History of the use of Gold and Silver as monetary metals in the world

The following is the list of civilizations that used precious metals as money:

    • Egyptians
    • Chinese
    • Greek
    • Romans
    • Modern Europeans
    • India (magadh-1900s)
    • USA (1700s-1960s)

After the great depression and the world wars

After the was, a new flawed monetary system was made by  the winner of the world war 2 (and a big economy). 
This cemented the success of America. As the all the worlds currencies were backed by the US dollar, 
which was in turn backed by gold.The US government print many multiple times the US dollars than the 
gold it had in its reserves, during the guns and butter economy.

This meant that the US was fighting the Vietnam war, and at the same time it was fighting in the space 
race v/s the soviet union.

This lead the foreign governments like france to redeem their dollars for gold and demanded  physical delivery.
Seeing the gold outflow, President Nixon immediately stopped the convertability of the dollar into gold in 
1971 (on 15 th of August by chance).

This caused the runaway inflation in the 1970s.
This is known as the Nixon crash.
Before this, the US government also removed all the silver from all it’s coins, but also kept the looks of coins the same.
Then it used its power to end the soviet union.

But the next crash was even bigger

The dot com crash

    • The internet was getting popular and overhyped in the 1990s.

    • It created a bubble.
      
    • The fed lowered the rates.
      
    • This caused the speculation to increase.
      
    • This let the useless companies like VA Linux also get the money.

    • Many more companies were formed.
      
    • Then no more money was available to invest.
      
    • The bubble burst.
      
    • A lot of money was lost.
      
    • But companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Facebook, Google lived on, becoming the largest companies in history.

    • A lot of companies went bust.
      
    • But the upcoming crash was even worse.
      
    • Although the internet became very popular these companies never came back.
      
The Housing bubble

    • In 2000s, banks were lending like crazy, to this new-fangled real-estate package thing.
      
    • This was very risky as they lent to random people with little      income.
      
    • More and more people started buying homes as anyone was getting the loan to buy one.
      
    • This lead to the real estate price skyrocketing.
      
    • Many people who shouldn’t get home loans,got home loans.
      
    • Many people started buying homes  started buying homes.
      
    • When the bubble popped a lot of homes were foreclosed.
      
    • But the loan they had taken was for a  lot higher amount than they would get by selling the homes.
      
    • This caused huge losses to the banks.
    • The trust in the US was temporarily lost.
      
    • The government started forcing people to spend using policies like ObamaCare.  


The Upcoming Crisis

The upcoming crisis is going to be really bad.

As 2020 covid lockdowns hit
    • US govt started sending stimulus checks
    • Fed Started QE
    • biden’s family plan
    • infrastructure bill
    • Prices alway rising

The stock market is at artificially high valuations.

Real Estate prices are skyrocketing (in US).

Food prices are rising.

There is a lot of debt (more than the entire economy of US itself)!

This means that the economy is in a bubble as the money is transferred from the fed to the stock 
market and real estate market.

The US dollar has lost more that 20 percent of its value in one year. 
(The FED is lying as they revise the CPI to show lower and lower numbers every year.)
They even stopped reporting the money supply numbers.

There will be alteast a small crisis.

The end of an era and the everything bubble.

If the government converts the private sector to the public sector, they know that they don’t have 
any reason to improve their work as they don’t have competition or relevant competition.

The precious metals coin minting business dosen’t require you to have a more better product , as 
the value and guaranteed fineness is the same.

It requires trust (which we have in our government more than random people who can give less silver/gold).

The banking sector dosen’t require that level of trust,but it requires a stable rate 
(or atleast less influence from one entity) and a good rate which maintains the stability of the economy.

The current economy ( in 2021) has a lot of speculation going on in it. Stock market , Real estate 
, etc. If this continues, then this could be the very end of the fiat system.

Of course, I being a human can not predict the future with a 100% accuracy

Even bigger booms and busts and “great”er problems

Keynsian economists often say that the booms are lower than they should be and vice versa for busts, but during a boom 
(like in 2020 or 2008 or 2000 or 1920,etc) the booms have continuously reached record highs, this indicates
that flatening the booms and busts is not working. Same for busts, the 2000s crisis
was much lower than 08 which was lower than what (may very well be) a very large bust, unimaginably large.

Austrian economists like limited government and no central bank (or fiat currency), 
that means, they cannot artificially low rates to create booms, or do anything like that.

The only thing is, if a natural disaster occurs, then, there will be a problem, but 
after the rich people figure out what to do, (because their businessess are affected), 
then the free market will do its job.

What is fiat money and what is real money?

Fiat means “Let it be done” in latin.
Basically like an order.
Fiat money means “Money having no intrinsic or melt value, but has value based on the sole fact that the
government has a monopoly on money creation.

Whereas real money has it’s value on the fact that there is a lot of work and effort to mine it.

Government money was just a promise that this coin has a set amount of silver in it and has a set
amout of purity. This dosen’t mean that they control the supply because the miners do, but 
we can use regular silver as well.

Silver Savings

    • Imagine your great-great-grandfater
      
    • (because they were before license raj)
      
    • They getting some money as a child.
      
    • You can Still melt them and buy the same stuff as that much money could buy in that times.

    • But now imagine your father
      
    • (because they were after license raj mostly)
      
    • The money they got as a child were cupronickel or steel coins
    •  (which have 0% silver)

    • If you melt those , you wont get any money.
      
    • If you use them as regular money, they will have a lot less value than they used to have.
      
    • This is the power of silver (and gold!)
      
    • The reason that we don’t use silver coins are because of their artificially low value
      
    • This is because of ETFs.

Derivatives and the problems they cause.

The current currency market is very volatile.
If 	 	     ,is a mesure of  		 Would change everyday
  Meter				            length
  kg					      mass
  litre				            volume

It would cause a lot of problems.

Even if currency changes this would be similarly a problem as it is a measure of wealth.

If lets say a company invest 10,000 dollars in India , they will invest  700,000 rupees but if three
yrs lates 1 $=100 rupees, if their business grows to 1,000,000 rupees  ,still they will only get 10,000 dollars back.

In comes derivatives.

$1= 70 rs in ‘21
$1= 100 rs in some year
you can make a contract with the other company to exchange some money at a specific date at the 
price you paid or a set price so it reduces your risk.	    		          


GDP and Inflation

Some Keynsian economists say that an increase in GDP will cause an increase in inflation, as the economy is is 
running “RED HOT”, but this is not true, in fact, in 2020, even if the prices were rising , the govt
spending economy (ie GDP) and real  economy (excluding the “G” ie Government part) was shrinking, still the 
prices were rising. Even now this is the case.

GDP is the sum of all transactions, which means that all GDP is, is the sum of all the spending in the economy.

If you look at a beggar, he is 28,000,000,000,000+ dollars (i.e 28+ Trillion dollars)
richer than the USA government as US debt is at 28+ Trillion.

28 Trillion (even adjusted for inflation) is one of if not the largest debt ever incurred by any government.

I agree that MV=PT

M=Money supply - increased
V=Velocity –  has decreased more
P=Average Price – increased
T=Number of transcactions – decreased more

M*V=P*T
That’s Why inflation has not showed itself (to that extent) in the Real prices.

But it has shown itself in the Stock and Real Estate markets.

Why devalue your own currency?

If someone of some company wants to buy some things from India and they want to buy some stuff.
If the cost of producing that stuff remains the same but the price of $/Rs Falls, this 
is a advantage as foreign companies can buy a lot more stuff for a lesser price than other countries,
that means more stuff from India gets exported and it increases our real
economy and nominal gdp.

Another advantage is that you can show that your economy grew by a lot more percent than it actually did.


Gold

Gold has been used as money for thousands of years from the egyptians to the americans to the europeans.

Gold is a really unique metal as it has that sort of golden colour which no other metal has.

Gold also has a limited supply, so you can save your money in just a handful of coins.

Gold also has a lower price than it should really have , that is , “it’s undervalued”.

Gold is not that volatile as compared to other metals.




Silver

Silver has also been money for thousands of years

You can store your entire amount of wealth in a bag as well as it can be less value at a time.

For example 1 silver dime=1 burger,etc.

Silver is a lot more undervalued as compared to gold.

Silver has been made in india from the very beginning of the free market.
The fiat money standard and problems

Voltaire famously said, 'Fiat currency always eventually returns to its intrinsic value-zero'. Unfortunately,
we're watching the final stages of that process unfold now.
The problem with fiat currencies is that it can be created out of thin air.  
The Chineese were the first to implement a  fiat currency which caused the entire chinese economy to fall very rapidly.

The world is heavily monetized and a lot greedy, and unfortunately things are getting 
a lot worse than anything you can imagine.

If they let the “Inflation geine” back into the “bottle”, they would crush the economy,
worse than the Great Depression. If they continuously stimulate they will cause hyperinflation and crash 
the economy any ways. In other words, they are between a rock and a hard place.

What really is Is inflation

Inflation is an increase in the money supply within an economy. 

Nowadays, if they used the correct definition, they would not be able to print this much money, 
as they would have caught the public’s attention. The point is that if they say that inflation is a rise in 
prices and not that inflation causes rise in prices, they can basically say that inflation and money supply are not 
correlated, which allows them to raise money supply which raises prices 
dramatically, either due to rising prices or shrinkflation.

Now what is this shrinkflation thing?
Imaging a biscuit packet, which costs around Rs. P and you get 
N number of biscuits. price/biscuit = P/N, if N falls , the real price will rise

The word inflation is an analogy to the baloon and the air is the money supply.

This has not only happened to English but to French, German, Hindi, Marathi, etc.

Keynsian Coins

The coins in a Keynsian economy have a intrinsic value a fraction of their face value.

The money supply keeps on increase as to be more competitive in thhe market or USA, increase welfare.

This means that the coins have to be returned each year or they will be driven out of circulation  
by the principles of Gresham’s law.

Gresham’s law states that if you have the face value more than the melt value, then it 
will be melted or sold at price of the metal and collected.

For example take the one rupee coin from 1930,
it has a face value of one rupee, but its melt value is in the thousands, therefore people collect 
it and don’t spend it. Same with other coins.

This would mean that the government would spend a lot of money on just minting coins.

So,the value of any fiat  coin is just a fraction of what it would take to produce it.
How does fiat money come in circulation?

First there was barter, this means you exchanged your goods for other’s goods. As the transactions increased,it became 
inconvenient to trade specific commoditites (ie goods that are fixed in value to each other) 
for other commodities. Then the most marketable commodity(ies) to exchange as money. 
Beads, shells,wheels,etc were used as money, but silver (and gold) became the most 
marketable as they can be cut, measured for purity, stamped, melted , cut , measured , stamped and so on and cause 
no damage to the content. They also store a medium amount of money in a place, for example 10 cent 
(size of modern coin, modern coin has cupronickel instead of silver) for a burger (McDonalds,1950s).
Then they come up with an idea of a promissory notes (RBI in india), 
then they print a lot more than gold,silver they have, then they stop to redeem and remove metals from the coins and 
change the definitions (eg inflation old=money supply increase new=rising prices,money
=5-6 factors including store of value, new=generally accepted  medium of exchange)
In inflation:inflate means increase the air in the baloon. baloon=economy,air=money.

World currency

Having a world currency makes getting out of it ,difficult. This always causes problems and breaks down 
(eg. Scandanavian Monetary Union,
Latin Monetary Union
,Bretton woods,
UK pound backing before 1940s
,etc).

I think that a world currency like SDRs would be worse as  the fiat system is there and, it 
is global, so there is no way of escaping it.

Hyperinflation near

There very well be hyperinflation in the coming months and years as people are a lot greedy and if 
they stop giving the economy monetary push it always needs, then, the economy will collapse. The 
other option seems more likely : Hyperinflation.

What this means is that they have to keep injectin money into the economy until it turns into hyperinflation.
When they have to put money in, even faster as the people think that their money’s value keeps on decreasing really fast.
This encourages spending as they would be able to buy a lot more stuff than they will tomorrow.
 
This increases the M and V  in the MV=PT equation.

This means prices and transactions have to rise. 

This feeds on itself which causes hyperinflation and the collapse of the economy.

I think that this may be the thing that is going to happen to the global economy.
But there are only probabalities and no certainities, so do your own reasearch.
The probabilities are really high.

Continuously rising prices in a fiat economy

The prices are continuously rising as money supply increases. The keynsian economists say that MV!=PT but 
if stuff=the same and price increase , then the stuff will just sit idle as anyone will not be able to buy 
the remaining stuff, as more money is chasing the same amount of stuff.

This means that the money supply increase is the sole reason of rising prices.

If stuff supply increases, in a non-fiat economy, prices will fall ,so that people can buy all the stuff, 
causing deflation, as same money is chasing more goods.

The methods used to make things has improved, causing the price to make things fall
, but using the same method, price=the same.

Therefore, the rising prices are a effect of increase of the money supply.

The improvement in technology has resulted in a fall of prices (adjust for real inflation).
If a tax is imposed on  a product, the product has  not inflated as the method used is different, 
it is the method plus an additional step which is paying money to the government. Of 
course the price of the tax has been added.

If additional environmental factors are added, same thing is true.

Conclusion:

The method used to make the stuff is more important as it reveals all the prices attatched in making the stuff.

Interest rates and money supply

Interest rates affect inflation as if rates are low, thhis encourages the people to borrow more, the opposite is 
true if rates are high.

The money supply is influenced by this and the reserve requirement as the money borrowed, is 
deposited, is borrowed, is deposited and so on until the banks all have money until the reserve requirement. 

Booms and busts

As you might have read, these crises like great depression, dot com, great recession are the busts of roaring 20s, 
internet hype of 90s, subprime mortgage boom. These are caused because of the central banks lowering 
the interest rate. Looking at such rates, regular people might think, that this signals a big economic 
growth, and a lot of savers are accepting such a low real rate for their savings account. Let’s say, the free 
market savings rate is around 4%, then, the borrowig rate will be 7-8%, lets take 7%. If the central bank steps 
in, and lowers the rate, the private banks can borrow the money from the central bank at 3%, then this will reduce the 
savings rate to <1% (as is the case in America). This means, that a lot of hype-oriented and regular 
businessess will open, this will cause malinvestmnet, and bankruptcy.

Debasement 

As I told you in the Banking Speculators section, the rupee is debased by quite a 
lot, and you don’t even understand.Banks also get cheated by this.I am now 
talking about a different type of debasement, debasement in silver. 

Even Adam Smith, in his book “The Wealth of Nations” admits that the british pound has been devalued a 
lot (i.e He talks about English,Scottish,Irish Pounds and the fractions of the real thing they are). 

The british pound has lost 99.9% of its value, this is not great, as the people who 
had lent the british govt some money for war,got a lot lot less money than they gave the government. This is cheating.

The indian rupee is 1/3000 of it's originial value
