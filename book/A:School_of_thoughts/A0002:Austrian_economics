Austrian Economics

Silver and gold can hold a lot of value in a single place.
Your life savings in a bag.Fiat money is devalued at a rated of 2-5% per year. If you compound it,it’s huge!
Fiat money can be created out of thin air.What is the fiat thing I am talking about? Well your ₹$£¥ are all fiat,
at least the day-to-day ones. The rupee has lost ~99.9% of its value! The dollar >95%.If this continues,
we will have th carry 50 rupee coins that have the value of todays 1 rupee. Even the inflation rate is understated.
Central banks have central control,they are the sole issuer of currency,they have the control over the interest rate,
which has devastating consequences (for example 1920s 1970s 200s and the upcoming 2021 crisis).Central banks have
always printed more promissory notes than there is money.

If there is no central banks, there will be less booms and busts,and if you let these businessess go bust, this will 
allocate the capital properly.

Gold and silver price have been severly understated because the big bank have large short positions in silver.
The USA has a lot of welfare programs like social security , medicare,child tax credit,free education,etc, which costs the 
US government a lot of money. Even the taxes are low, and they aren’t rising anytime soon.

The economy is an evolving system and not a machine,so the government can’t possibly know all the information necessary 
to change things, but companies will. Also there is no competition to the government, but there is to the companies, 
this lowers the prices to correct levels.
