Keynsian Economics End

Keynsian economics was started by John Maynard Keynes in the great depression because he thought that the economy was not
controlled enough.

But this was false as, before the fed, when there were no wars and no central banking in the  USA,
there was no crash as big as or even distantly close to the great depression or the dot com crash or 2008.

The end of keynsian economics may not necessarily  be near, but their ideas are going to fail and be disproven really quickly.

The one thing that he said right was "Ideas shape the course of history." 

The recession have become worse, every time (dot com vs 08)
