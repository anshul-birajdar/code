Centralized power often leads to disasted:Fall of communism ,and keynsian economics

As the Classical and Austrian economics don’t say that do this , do that ,etc, they are just mere observations of the 
free market and not a controlling market like a Keynesian economy, as the government wouldn’t provide the interest 
rates and constantly changing the value of their money, the progress is dependant on the magical hand that is the 
free market, that the government has wounded.

Communism fell as the govt. officials didn’t care producing  better products that the economy needs.

Like that, the government has no incentive to lower rates, even the central bankers do not have any incentive 
to better their economy and drive progress.

This means that eventually the free market has to win.

The fed is not a part of the government but a public private partnership.

Let’s see what happens to the “Fed”
