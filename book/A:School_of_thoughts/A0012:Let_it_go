Let it Go!

Capitalism was founded on the basis, that the “capital” or money will be allocated properly by individuals properly.
Let’s say there is a big bank, who lends money to this questionable, but big company. Now this company goes bust, the 
company had loaned the money from the banks, now the money is lost. This means that the banks who had lent the money 
to this company, their money is lost. They had not lent the money properly, then it’s their fault, such an institution
should not exist.

If these irresponsible banks lend their money to these people, then these banks’s account holders money,
or the general public’s money is lost. This means that the failed institution loses the money.

If you let these big megacorporations go bust, the capital will outflow from their companies and to the share
holder,who then can do good to the economy ie spend or create new companies (invest)
