Bonds, Bonds and Bonds

The US government unloads a lot of treasuries ( i.e US govt. debt, i.e. bonds). The supply of those bonds increases, so 
the nominal price for those bonds should decrease, i.e rising interest rate, as the payment is fixed, but just the
opposite happens.

Why?
Because the “fed” buys a lot of bonds by creating money out of thing air and giving it to the primary dealer banks
i.e. the top bankers club some money. This leaves really less bonds actually circulating, hence the low yeilds.

The US government and federal reserve play this sort of role, otherwise the economy would have collapsed.

The fed created the great depression, 1970s stagflation,2000s tech bubble, and 2007-8 real estate crash.

Now all of those combined is coming i.e great depression+stagflation+tech bubble+real estate bubble. 

This is going to be a really bad time!
The federal government and the “fed” are going to keep on doing this, but to save from this are only to options.
