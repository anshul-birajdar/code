Borrowing vs printing

From the outside, it may seem that the US government is “borrowing” the money from the free market,
but the opposite is true, they are “injecting” the money into the free market by printing it. 

How is this possible?
It is possible because of what I call the “Printing to Borrowing” activity.

Basically what is done is that the govt borrows the money from the primary dealer banks, they then sell the bond to the fed.
The “fed” doesn’t doesn’t recieve a lot of money or any money, so it has to print the money out of thin air, otherwise it 
will cause deflation or 0% inflation and 0% deflation.
