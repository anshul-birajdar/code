Banking Speculators

The banks have be turned into speculators because, they are cheated by the fiat, as they are lending in a more 
valuable rupee and getting returned in a lesser valued rupee, that means, that their returns are diminished 
and they are fooled.

The banks, using people’s money, have started to put the money directly into the stock market. This yeilds a higher 
return, and is also a roughly accurate measure of inflation (at good times, and indexes like 
Nifty50 or Standard and Poor’s S&P 500).

This means that, if the banks remove their money , or a big crisis (like I am predicting) occurs, then the banks will 
face severy problems, that means, the people may or may not be able to get their money or the money’s value 
will be the value of the piece of paper (like 1920s germany Weimar Republic).
