Put the genie back in the bottle!

The “Fed” which is neither federal nor has reserves say that they can put the inflation genie back in the bottle or 
cut inflation by raising rates, but they can’t do that.
Why?
Because they have 28+ Trillion dollars in debt, it will absolutely crush the insolvent government.

Even if the government didn’t get crushed, the economy will be in one of the worst depressions in the history of central 
banking, and all the blame would be transferred to the Federal Reserve ie “Fed”.
