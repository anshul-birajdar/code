The Upcoming Crisis

The upcoming crisis is going to be really bad.

As 2020 covid lockdowns hit
    • US govt started sending stimulus checks
    • Fed Started QE
    • biden’s family plan
    • infrastructure bill
    • Prices alway rising

The stock market is at artificially high valuations.

Real Estate prices are skyrocketing (in US).

Food prices are rising.

There is a lot of debt (more than the entire economy of US itself)!

This means that the economy is in a bubble as the money is transferred from the fed to the stock 
market and real estate market.

The US dollar has lost more that 20 percent of its value in one year. 
(The FED is lying as they revise the CPI to show lower and lower numbers every year.)
They even stopped reporting the money supply numbers.

There will be alteast a small crisis.
