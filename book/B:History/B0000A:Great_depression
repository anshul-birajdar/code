Great depression and the run on the banks

The term “run on the bank” means that everyone is rushing to the bank to withdraw their money at once.
Of course, the banks don’t have all the money with them at once, this doesn’t mean,
that they don’t have the money, it’s just that it is not available at once.
The great depression caused most banks to fail , this resulted in a bigger depression,
this was caused by the  central bank of the United states, the federal reserve.

All of these banks, who already lent the money, of course don’t have the money in hand.
This is how things work, but the depression, which was caused by the “fed”, this resulted in the great 
depression, and the run on the banks.
