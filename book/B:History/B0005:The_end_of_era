The end of an era and the everything bubble.

If the government converts the private sector to the public sector, they know that they don’t have 
any reason to improve their work as they don’t have competition or relevant competition.

The precious metals coin minting business dosen’t require you to have a more better product , as 
the value and guaranteed fineness is the same.

It requires trust (which we have in our government more than random people who can give less silver/gold).

The banking sector dosen’t require that level of trust,but it requires a stable rate 
(or atleast less influence from one entity) and a good rate which maintains the stability of the economy.

The current economy ( in 2021) has a lot of speculation going on in it. Stock market , Real estate 
, etc. If this continues, then this could be the very end of the fiat system.

Of course, I being a human can not predict the future with a 100% accuracy
