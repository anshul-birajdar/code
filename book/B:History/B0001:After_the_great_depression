After the great depression and the world wars

After the was, a new flawed monetary system was made by  the winner of the world war 2 (and a big economy). 
This cemented the success of America. As the all the worlds currencies were backed by the US dollar, 
which was in turn backed by gold.The US government print many multiple times the US dollars than the 
gold it had in its reserves, during the guns and butter economy.

This meant that the US was fighting the Vietnam war, and at the same time it was fighting in the space 
race v/s the soviet union.

This lead the foreign governments like france to redeem their dollars for gold and demanded  physical delivery.
Seeing the gold outflow, President Nixon immediately stopped the convertability of the dollar into gold in 
1971 (on 15 th of August by chance).

This caused the runaway inflation in the 1970s.
This is known as the Nixon crash.
Before this, the US government also removed all the silver from all itâ€™s coins, but also kept the looks of coins the same.
Then it used its power to end the soviet union.

But the next crash was even bigger
