Even bigger booms and busts and “great”er problems

Keynsian economists often say that the booms are lower than they should be and vice versa for busts, but during a boom 
(like in 2020 or 2008 or 2000 or 1920,etc) the booms have continuously reached record highs, this indicates
that flatening the booms and busts is not working. Same for busts, the 2000s crisis
was much lower than 08 which was lower than what (may very well be) a very large bust, unimaginably large.

Austrian economists like limited government and no central bank (or fiat currency), 
that means, they cannot artificially low rates to create booms, or do anything like that.

The only thing is, if a natural disaster occurs, then, there will be a problem, but 
after the rich people figure out what to do, (because their businessess are affected), 
then the free market will do its job.
