Basics of economics
The most basic thing in economics is demand and supply.
If there is a lot of onion, onions will be cheap, the reverse will happen if onions are not available. 
Let’s say you want a toy car, and everyone wants a toy car, there are only so many cars available at same time and
everyone is buying a lot of them, this temporarily pushes the price up, and then to regular levels.
Now we will discuss about resources. Let’s say you own a large toy factory which makes toy train sets.
To make the toy, you need plastic. As plastic is not unlimited, there is a cost you have to pay,
so that  the plastic makers can part their plastic.This is decided on the demand-supply of plastic as mentioned before.
They sell their plastic for the paper rupee as most people will give them rupees and they expect that they can
(or their shareholders can) acquire goods and services for that money.
A company is a organisation of people (or part-owners / share-holders).A company, lets take the toy company,
you will need to design the train and the tracks. If you don’t know how to make tracks,then you will employ people,
if you want to invest you money, you can otherwise raise money by selling your part-ownership in the company.
Then you have enough money to build the factories and the brand.When someone buys your toy , you make a slight   profit,
that is Selling Price-Cost Price or CP-SP.
The profits can then be used to make a better product, or be given to the shareholders as dividends.
How can the the resources be distributed?
 By land ownership, which can be used  to mine silver, gold, aluminium, steel, etc, can be used to grow crop,etc.
There are two  parts of economics, microeconomics and macroeconomics.
