How does fiat money come in circulation?

First there was barter, this means you exchanged your goods for otherâ€™s goods. As the transactions increased,it became 
inconvenient to trade specific commoditites (ie goods that are fixed in value to each other) 
for other commodities. Then the most marketable commodity(ies) to exchange as money. 
Beads, shells,wheels,etc were used as money, but silver (and gold) became the most 
marketable as they can be cut, measured for purity, stamped, melted , cut , measured , stamped and so on and cause 
no damage to the content. They also store a medium amount of money in a place, for example 10 cent 
(size of modern coin, modern coin has cupronickel instead of silver) for a burger (McDonalds,1950s).
Then they come up with an idea of a promissory notes (RBI in india), 
then they print a lot more than gold,silver they have, then they stop to redeem and remove metals from the coins and 
change the definitions (eg inflation old=money supply increase new=rising prices,money
=5-6 factors including store of value, new=generally accepted  medium of exchange)
In inflation:inflate means increase the air in the baloon. baloon=economy,air=money.
