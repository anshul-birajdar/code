Silver Savings

    • Imagine your great-great-grandfater
      
    • (because they were before license raj)
      
    • They getting some money as a child.
      
    • You can Still melt them and buy the same stuff as that much money could buy in that times.

    • But now imagine your father
      
    • (because they were after license raj mostly)
      
    • The money they got as a child were cupronickel or steel coins
    •  (which have 0% silver)

    • If you melt those , you wont get any money.
      
    • If you use them as regular money, they will have a lot less value than they used to have.
      
    • This is the power of silver (and gold!)
      
    • The reason that we don’t use silver coins are because of their artificially low value
      
    • This is because of ETFs.
