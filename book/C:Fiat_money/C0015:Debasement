Debasement 

As I told you in the Banking Speculators section, the rupee is debased by quite a 
lot, and you don’t even understand.Banks also get cheated by this.I am now 
talking about a different type of debasement, debasement in silver. 

Even Adam Smith, in his book “The Wealth of Nations” admits that the british pound has been devalued a 
lot (i.e He talks about English,Scottish,Irish Pounds and the fractions of the real thing they are). 

The british pound has lost 99.9% of its value, this is not great, as the people who 
had lent the british govt some money for war,got a lot lot less money than they gave the government. This is cheating.

The indian rupee is 1/3000 of it's originial value
