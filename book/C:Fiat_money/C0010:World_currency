World currency

Having a world currency makes getting out of it ,difficult. This always causes problems and breaks down 
(eg. Scandanavian Monetary Union,
Latin Monetary Union
,Bretton woods,
UK pound backing before 1940s
,etc).

I think that a world currency like SDRs would be worse as  the fiat system is there and, it 
is global, so there is no way of escaping it.
