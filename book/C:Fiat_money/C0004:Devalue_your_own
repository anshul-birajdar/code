Why devalue your own currency?

If someone of some company wants to buy some things from India and they want to buy some stuff.
If the cost of producing that stuff remains the same but the price of $/Rs Falls, this 
is a advantage as foreign companies can buy a lot more stuff for a lesser price than other countries,
that means more stuff from India gets exported and it increases our real
economy and nominal gdp.

Another advantage is that you can show that your economy grew by a lot more percent than it actually did.
