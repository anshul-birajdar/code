Keynsian Coins

The coins in a Keynsian economy have a intrinsic value a fraction of their face value.

The money supply keeps on increase as to be more competitive in thhe market or USA, increase welfare.

This means that the coins have to be returned each year or they will be driven out of circulation  
by the principles of Gresham’s law.

Gresham’s law states that if you have the face value more than the melt value, then it 
will be melted or sold at price of the metal and collected.

For example take the one rupee coin from 1930,
it has a face value of one rupee, but its melt value is in the thousands, therefore people collect 
it and don’t spend it. Same with other coins.

This would mean that the government would spend a lot of money on just minting coins.

So,the value of any fiat  coin is just a fraction of what it would take to produce it.
