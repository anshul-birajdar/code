What is fiat money and what is real money?

Fiat means “Let it be done” in latin.
Basically like an order.
Fiat money means “Money having no intrinsic or melt value, but has value based on the sole fact that the
government has a monopoly on money creation.

Whereas real money has it’s value on the fact that there is a lot of work and effort to mine it.

Government money was just a promise that this coin has a set amount of silver in it and has a set
amout of purity. This dosen’t mean that they control the supply because the miners do, but 
we can use regular silver as well.
