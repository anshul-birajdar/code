The fiat money standard and problems

Voltaire famously said, 'Fiat currency always eventually returns to its intrinsic value-zero'. Unfortunately,
we're watching the final stages of that process unfold now.

The Chineese were the first to implement a  fiat currency which caused the entire chinese economy to fall very rapidly.

The world is heavily monetized and a lot greedy, and unfortunately things are getting 
a lot worse than anything you can imagine.

If they let the “Inflation geine” back into the “bottle”, they would crush the economy,
worse than the Great Depression. If they continuously stimulate they will cause hyperinflation and crash 
the economy any ways. In other words, they are between a rock and a hard place.
