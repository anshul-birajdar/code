Interest rates and money supply

Interest rates affect inflation as if rates are low, thhis encourages the people to borrow more, the opposite is 
true if rates are high.

The money supply is influenced by this and the reserve requirement as the money borrowed, is 
deposited, is borrowed, is deposited and so on until the banks all have money until the reserve requirement.
