What really is Is inflation

Inflation is an increase in the money supply within an economy. 

Nowadays, if they used the correct definition, they would not be able to print this much money, 
as they would have caught the publicâ€™s attention. The point is that if they say that inflation is a rise in 
prices and not that inflation causes rise in prices, they can basically say that inflation and money supply are not 
correlated, which allows them to raise money supply which raises prices 
dramatically, either due to rising prices or shrinkflation.

Now what is this shrinkflation thing?
Imaging a biscuit packet, which costs around Rs. P and you get 
N number of biscuits. price/biscuit = P/N, if N falls , the real price will rise

The word inflation is an analogy to the baloon and the air is the money supply.

This has not only happened to English but to French, German, Hindi, Marathi, etc.
