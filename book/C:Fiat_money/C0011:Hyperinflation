Hyperinflation near

There very well be hyperinflation in the coming months and years as people are a lot greedy and if 
they stop giving the economy monetary push it always needs, then, the economy will collapse. The 
other option seems more likely : Hyperinflation.

What this means is that they have to keep injectin money into the economy until it turns into hyperinflation.
When they have to put money in, even faster as the people think that their moneyâ€™s value keeps on decreasing really fast.
This encourages spending as they would be able to buy a lot more stuff than they will tomorrow.
 
This increases the M and V  in the MV=PT equation.

This means prices and transactions have to rise. 

This feeds on itself which causes hyperinflation and the collapse of the economy.

I think that this may be the thing that is going to happen to the global economy.
But there are only probabalities and no certainities, so do your own reasearch.
The probabilities are really high.
