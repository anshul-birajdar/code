GDP and Inflation

Some Keynsian economists say that an increase in GDP will cause an increase in inflation, as the economy is is 
running “RED HOT”, but this is not true, in fact, in 2020, even if the prices were rising , the govt
spending economy (ie GDP) and real  economy (excluding the “G” ie Government part) was shrinking, still the 
prices were rising. Even now this is the case.

GDP is the sum of all transactions, which means that all GDP is, is the sum of all the spending in the economy.

If you look at a beggar, he is 28,000,000,000,000+ dollars (i.e 28+ Trillion dollars)
richer than the USA government as US debt is at 28+ Trillion.

28 Trillion (even adjusted for inflation) is one of if not the largest debt ever incurred by any government.

I agree that MV=PT

M=Money supply - increased
V=Velocity –  has decreased more
P=Average Price – increased
T=Number of transcactions – decreased more

M*V=P*T
That’s Why inflation has not showed itself (to that extent) in the Real prices.

But it has shown itself in the Stock and Real Estate markets.
