Race to the bottom!

Most central bankers and central planners often say one phrase many times, which is, you guessed it, “Race to the bottom”.

They often say this for taxes,GDP,etc,etc, but I am talking about the fiat system itself that these central bankers have 
created.

They are constantly devaluing their currecy , at the same time, so that people don’t understand that the currencies 
have fallen.

But the scary thing is that the entire fiat system collapsing. This is coming soon.
