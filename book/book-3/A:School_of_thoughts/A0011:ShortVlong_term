Short-term inflation and rebound vs long-term inflation and their effects.

Short term inflation means short term rise in (money supply * velocity)+ or - short term problems which causes prices to
rise and fall to the same levels

Long-term inflation means long term rise in prices caused by a huge increase in the money supply

Did you understand the difference (cause and effect)?

For example, the cost required to make a book goes up because of a fire in the forests, it will rebound after some time.

The increase in the money supply will cause all things’s prices to go up every year. For example if a book costs 50 rupees 
and inflation is 5%, in five years, the cost will be 65 rupees.A 30 % increase.

This means that Keynsian economy’s currency’s value declines over time, then how do the coins have their value?
