Reserve requirements and ban  on speculation

Banks were heavily regulated, as not to allow people to borrow to speculate (or put in the stock market).
This was so that the stock market was based on the economy and not the other way around.

What is the stock market?
The stock market is the market that determines the price of the big companies, which shape the economy.

If you encourage speculation,then it will just create a bigger boom and bust cycle.
The market is always in a boom and bust cycle.

For example if we see that internet giants are earning a lot of money, then the internet stocks will rise.

If a big internet provider reports a loss, the tech stocks will fall.

These boom and bust cycle don’t cause any  problems, if and only if the government dosen’t allow people 
to borrow money, just to put into the stock market, as the money entered into the stock market.
Most of the money has to exit some way or the other.
