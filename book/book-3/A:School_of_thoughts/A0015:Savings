Save! Save! Save!

They always encourage people to save money, but with the rapidly declining value of paper currencies like the rupee or
the dollar. The inflation metric used by the cental banks, always understates inflation. Even if you count the inflation
rate in India, as 6 percent and save for 20 years, your savings will be cut in third, in reality, it is a lot worse because
of the rupee losing a lot more value.

Dollar to Rupee is a not-so-good way to measure the debasement of the rupee to the dollar, because they can , and do
devalue their currencies at once, to fool people into thinking that the money didnâ€™t lose power.
