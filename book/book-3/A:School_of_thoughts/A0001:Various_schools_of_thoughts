Various schools of thought in economics- Austrian, Keynsian,Communist

Austrian ecnomics roughly says that the economy is a complex machine and shouln’t be controlled by a single entity.
This means silver/gold coins are preferred. No central bank.The role of the government is to defend us,to build 
infrastucture, mint silver/gold coins in verified amounts to allow trade, and regulate companies for their foul play
and uncompetitive behaviour. It also says that let businessess go bust,
don’t create central banks, and the economy is a evoloving system and not a machine.

Keynsian economics argues that free market requires regular intervention. This idea was cerated during the great
depression as people started to think that the gold standard, less regulation,resulted in the great depression,
it was quite the opposite. I have talked about this in the macro economic section.The bretton woods system,
which gave USA a lot of power as £¥₹ were backed by dollars. The dollars, then were convertible to gold. The US printed
a lot more dollar than it had gold to back it up.After that even if countries tried, they couldn’t go back to the gold
standard because most the gold is in the US and the price is a lot lower. The gold was in the US, but they could import
a lot of stuff buy just printing dollars (look at the US debt it is larger than the entire GDP of China, and USA itself,
as of 2021).
That means they can send dollars, and the world will send them stuff.

Communism believes that government should own everything and  everyone should work for  the government.

Various schools of thought are liked by many, but laissez fairre capitalism is the principle that works the best.
The Austrians completely support this,the keynsians are OK with it and communist completely oppose it.
