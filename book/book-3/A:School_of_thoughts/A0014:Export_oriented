Export oriented growth and globalization

Export oriented growth is on rise as people think that exporting will be good for the economy, but letâ€™s think the 
following. Peter Schiff has made this analogy:

There are 5 asians (indians,chinese), and one american. They are hungry, so they divide the work as follws:
One asian will do the hunting, another will fish, third will search for vegetation, fourth will cook the 
food and the fifth will cook food.The american will eat the food.

This means that there is no need of exporting to be good, but to raise GDP and show that things are made in India, 
this is a good thing.
