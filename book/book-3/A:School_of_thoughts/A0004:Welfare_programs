cost money

Where do the get this money from ? The taxes don’t even make a dent in the debt pile

The debt pile is in the trillions 28 Trillion, maybe 30 40 50 60 100. Then comes all the stimulus,
tax credits, infrastructure, etc, etc.  Even if they spend their entire tax revenue on it will take years to improve.

US government needs to pay salaries to his employees,  pay all sorts of bills , and much more, 
so it will take even more time to repay the debt.

If the inflation turns into hyperiflation, this will crash the economy.
The Federal reserve bank (central bank of USA) says that everything is OK (it isn’t). If they say that the economy is in  
a big trouble, this will crash the markets.
