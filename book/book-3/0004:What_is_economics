What is economics?
Economics is a field of study that studies how people value things and the production and consumption of goods
and services. If you have a Rs. 500 Note, What can you do with it?
If you have 1 silver coin, what can you do with that?
If you have a toy, what can you do with that?
There are limited resources and unlimited wants.
In economics  there are two sides. One is the goods and services side and  the other is the money side. 
Before money, there was barter.

Barter means exchanging goods for other goods instead of selling them for money. For example, if you have a Harry Potter
book and you trade it for a Game of thrones book.
But in real life, even to buy the book, you need money.

Money means a generally accepted medium of exchange which is:
fungible:all Rs.1=Rs.1
Durable:able to circulate without much damage Divisible:Rs.1=100p
Portable:can be carried around easily.
Scarcity:supply that can be made should be limited.
Store of value:It should hold its value for long periods of time.

Seeing this you might wonder, How come rupee is a store of value, it constantly devalues itself by 3%
per year?,which is huge.
Well, the Indian Rupee is not money, it is a currency, a money subsititute,it works because of its 
legal tender status, that is forcing people to accept it.

Rupee is really a silver coin, but it has been devalued.
