Derivatives and the problems they cause.

The current currency market is very volatile.
If 	 	     ,is a mesure of  		 Would change everyday
  Meter				            length
  kg					      mass
  litre				            volume

It would cause a lot of problems.

Even if currency changes this would be similarly a problem as it is a measure of wealth.

If lets say a company invest 10,000 dollars in India , they will invest  700,000 rupees but if three
yrs lates 1 $=100 rupees, if their business grows to 1,000,000 rupees  ,still they will only get 10,000 dollars back.

In comes derivatives.

$1= 70 rs in â€˜21
$1= 100 rs in some year
you can make a contract with the other company to exchange some money at a specific date at the 
price you paid or a set price so it reduces your risk.
