Booms and busts

As you might have read, these crises like great depression, dot com, great recession are the busts of roaring 20s, 
internet hype of 90s, subprime mortgage boom. These are caused because of the central banks lowering 
the interest rate. Looking at such rates, regular people might think, that this signals a big economic 
growth, and a lot of savers are accepting such a low real rate for their savings account. Letâ€™s say, the free 
market savings rate is around 4%, then, the borrowig rate will be 7-8%, lets take 7%. If the central bank steps 
in, and lowers the rate, the private banks can borrow the money from the central bank at 3%, then this will reduce the 
savings rate to <1% (as is the case in America). This means, that a lot of hype-oriented and regular 
businessess will open, this will cause malinvestmnet, and bankruptcy.
