Continuously rising prices in a fiat economy

The prices are continuously rising as money supply increases. The keynsian economists say that MV!=PT but 
if stuff=the same and price increase , then the stuff will just sit idle as anyone will not be able to buy 
the remaining stuff, as more money is chasing the same amount of stuff.

This means that the money supply increase is the sole reason of rising prices.

If stuff supply increases, in a non-fiat economy, prices will fall ,so that people can buy all the stuff, 
causing deflation, as same money is chasing more goods.

The methods used to make things has improved, causing the price to make things fall
, but using the same method, price=the same.

Therefore, the rising prices are a effect of increase of the money supply.

The improvement in technology has resulted in a fall of prices (adjust for real inflation).
If a tax is imposed on  a product, the product has  not inflated as the method used is different, 
it is the method plus an additional step which is paying money to the government. Of 
course the price of the tax has been added.

If additional environmental factors are added, same thing is true.

Conclusion:

The method used to make the stuff is more important as it reveals all the prices attatched in making the stuff.
