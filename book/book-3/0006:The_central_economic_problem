The Central problem of an economy is that 
a)What resources you have
A farmer, who lives there before owning, owns the land.
He can sell it, others can buy it, mine for metals, or farm for crop
Hence, the divisibility problem is solved.
The things you make are yours or you earn you salary.
Anything your owned companies own, you partly own,etc.

b)What should be produced
This depends on the owners and what is the demand.

c)Who wants these goods
Whoever wants it.
