Microeconomics

Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies of the behaviour of the people and companies
For example if people dump a lot of shares on the stock market(where people buy and sell stuff, in this case shares)
then, accoriding to demand and supply, the price will fall.
Factors of microeconomics include demand-supply,economies of scale
(which means producing a lot of stuff at once,more effectively),and what people and companies want and have.

Lets say your train set is is getting popular,and there is a lot of demand, then you can raise the price of your train,
but if you have less demand, you can lower the price, and start advertising your product.

If there is  a lot of demand for steel , when the economy is booming steel prices have to rise.

If the economy is at a standstill, then oil prices will fall, as in 2020.If the taxes on oil increase, then prices will rise.

If fiat money supply incereases, prices will rise.
This is known as inflation.

If a major company goes bust, the stock market will crash.
If a major company reported a 20% increase in revenue the stock market will generally rise.
