Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the economy as a whole.It uses central control such as tax rate, interest rate, to regulate the growth of the economy.
It uses metrics such as:
GDP:Sum of all transactions
Employment rate: No. Of adults having a job
Inflation: rise in the money supply,which raises prices
energy prices:cost of electricity
and other metrics to manupilate the growth.
The central bank, which holds the power to control interest rate and the money supply can do a lot of damage using 
macroeconomics like in 1920’s when it suddenly raised rates which caused many banks to go bust because they had
lent money at a lower rate, and now the fed has raised rates dramatically, which caused a lot of losses and then 
collapse of the banks.The economy which relies on the banks also collapsed.This caused a problem.After that, 
the Fed wanted to create a boom in the economy, so it lowered rates fast, and increased money supply. This lead 
to a great boom and bust in the stock market, as well as a complete collapse of a lot of banks.This caused the great 
depression.Although currently people are able to borrow money and start new businessess, they don’t know the long
term impact.If there were no central bank rates would be normalised because if the savers want higher rates for their 
savings and the lenders want a lower rate for their borrowing, they will choose the middle option as there will be
no money where there is low rates, this will force them to lower rates for borrowing and saving to the middle,if 
the savings rate is high,so borrowing rate also has to be higher. There will be a lot money deposited, but no one will 
borrow for such a high rate,this will force them to lower rates.
But the central banks have all time low borrowing rates, this is bad because the savers will also get less
(inflation adjusted) 7 (Max. Savings rate in fd) -5 (real inflation)=2% (real saving rate)

This is the more evil part of economics, as it tends to have central control, like communism
